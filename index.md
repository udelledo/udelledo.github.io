## Hello I'm Ugo

I'm a technology enthusiast since youth. As most of the kids I got attracted by the _games_ and became passionate about programming since the very first conding challenge I remember: a calculator in Turbo Pascal.

Since 2005 I had the luck to make coding my profession and since then the fun never stopped :)
